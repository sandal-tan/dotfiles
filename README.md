# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles and other environment things that I wanted to standardize.

This project will be my third (maybe fourth) iteration on my dotfiles collection. This go around, I am hoping to improve
both repeatability and documentation of my environment so I can continue to manage one environment instead of
monkey-patching it together as it is currently, and has always been for me.


To bootstrap a new environment:
    
    curl --silent https://git.io/JvO8d | bash

## `init.sh`

Bootstrap script for new hosts. Begins new machine setup.

## Notes

I would like to look into the following:

- [direnv](https://direnv.net/) for making sensitive environments
- [revolver](https://github.com/molovo/revolver) for pretty printing
- [ansi](https://github.com/fidian/ansi)
- [lj](https://github.com/molovo/lumberjack)
- [ondir](https://github.com/alecthomas/ondir)

- Python based messageing tool to interface with xanthia, fzf for history, and login info notifications
- TMUX and AWS hosting remote sessions

## Development
