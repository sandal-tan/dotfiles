# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles and other environment things that I wanted to standardize.

This project will be my third (maybe fourth) iteration on my dotfiles collection. This go around, I am hoping to improve
both repeatability and documentation of my environment so I can continue to manage one environment instead of
monkey-patching it together as it is currently, and has always been for me.


To bootstrap a new environment:
    
    curl --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sandal-tan/dotfiles/master/init.sh | bash

## `init.sh`

Bootstrap script for new hosts. Begins new machine setup.
